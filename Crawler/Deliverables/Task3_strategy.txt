Task	3:		

In first question, priority of retrieved URLs has been defined that pages	in	a	shallower	depth	are	more important	than	deeper	ones so we should cover depth of both pages serially.
My approach would be saving the count of number of URL retrieved at each level. 
While merging we could use this URL count to merge lower count depth so that we retain important links only.

Merit of this approach
1) Shallower links will be saved which contain more information than links at deep depth

Demerit of this approach
1) We need to save the count in a structure which takes space.
