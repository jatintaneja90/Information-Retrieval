It was founded in the United Kingdom as a government-sponsored initiative in 1992, following the global Earth Summit.[1]
Energy Saving Trust is an independent, not-for-profit organization funded by the government and the private sector.[2][3] It is a social enterprise, and also has a charitable foundation.[4] The EST has regional offices in England, and country offices in Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.[1][5] It maintains a comprehensive website, and a network of numerous local advice centres.[6]

History and purpose[edit]
The Energy Saving Trust was formally established in November 1992.[7][3] It was formed, as a public-private partnership, in response both to the director-general of Ofgas's 1991 proposal to increase energy efficiency in natural gas use,[8][9][10] and to the global June 1992 Earth Summit call to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent global warming and climate change.[1][11] In the wake of energy-supplier privatisation in the UK, the EST was also specifically formed as an instrument to ensure energy conservation and carbon-emission reduction in a free-market environment.[12][10] The structure, scope, nature, and funding of EST's activities and programmes have varied over the years due to governmental policy changes; however its primary focus  on consumers and households  has remained the same.[11][13] It is the largest provider of energy-saving advice, and has effected significant and measurable savings of energy, money, and carbon.[11]
EST's main goals are to achieve the sustainable use of energy and to cut carbon dioxide emissions. It acts as a bridge between consumers, government, trade, businesses, third sector organisations, local authorities, and the energy market.[2][4] The EST's target audience is consumers, local authorities, energy companies, and policy makers.[14] Among other activities, they provide:
Free advice, information, and action plans to individuals, organizations, communities, consumers, and the private sector on how to reduce carbon emissions, use water more sustainably, and save money on energy bills[5][2][4][15]
Grants and grant-finding advice for energy-saving projects, installations, and purchases[5][16]
Energy-saving certification, assurance, and accreditation services for businesses and consumer goods[17][5]
Independent and authoritative research, and policy analysis, in energy-conservation areas including household energy efficiency, low-carbon transport, renewable energy, and microgeneration[5][2]
Management or delivery of government programmes[4]
Testing of low-carbon technology[4]
Development of energy-efficient models and tools[4]
