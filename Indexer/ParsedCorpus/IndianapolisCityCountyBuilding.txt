The Indianapolis City-County Building is a 28-story building at 200 E. Washington Street in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana that houses the offices of the consolidated city-county government of Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana, known as Unigov, in its 665,534 square feet [1] of office space. It also houses the Marion County Courts and the headquarters of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and the Indianapolis City-County Council. The office of the Mayor of Indianapolis is on the top floor of the Indianapolis City-County Building.[2]
The building opened in 1962 after two years of construction,[3] at a cost of $22 million.[4] The City-County Building was the first building in the city to be taller than the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, and was the tallest building in the city until 1970.[3]
