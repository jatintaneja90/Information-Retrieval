Having had a passion for film and photography since the age of 10, March left Eton College at the first possible opportunity and at 17 worked for the film director Stanley Kubrick on the film Barry Lyndon.[1]
In 2012, a major exhibition of March's recent photographic work, Nature Translated, was staged at the Bermondsey Project Space in London. The exhibition was shown at the Marble Palace, part of the State Russian Museum in St Petersburg, in January 2014 and in Moscow as part of the Moscow Photography Biennale in April 2014. Two new exhibitions of Marchs photographs were held in early 2015: Wood Land which was held at Venus Over Manhattan Gallery in New York City, and Abstract and Intentional which was held at Hamiltons Gallery in London.

March moved from London to the family seat Goodwood to take over management of the estate, following the family tradition of the duke handing over management of the estate to the heir apparent when the latter turns forty.[1]
Motor sport at Goodwood was started by his grandfather, Freddie Richmond, who opened the Goodwood Motor Circuit in 1948. March established the Festival of Speed at Goodwood House in 1993. He then brought motor racing back to the circuit, which had closed in 1966, with the creation of the Goodwood Revival in 1998. Both events have since become recognised [according to whom?] as some of the most unusual, exciting and creative events in the world.
The Goodwood Estate covers 12,000 acres to the north of Chichester. The Goodwood Estate Company is a diverse portfolio of businesses which includes: Goodwood Racecourse, a 4,000 acre organic farm, two eighteen hole golf courses, Goodwood Aerodrome and Flying School, and a 91 bedroom hotel. The Group employs over 550 people and attracts 800,000 visitors to the Estate each year. The headquarters of Rolls Royce Motor Cars is also on the Estate.
Family[edit]
March lives in Goodwood House with his wife, Janet (ne Astor), and their four children.
March has been married twice, and has three sons and two daughters:
1) Sally Clayton (3 July 1976 to 1989); one daughter
I) Lady Alexandra Gordon-Lennox (born 1985)
2) The Honourable Janet Elizabeth Astor (1 December 1961), daughter of the 3rd Viscount Astor (30 November 1991 to date); one daughter and three sons
II) Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, Lord Settrington (born 20 December 1994), is the Earl's heir apparent
III) The Hon. William Rupert Charles Gordon-Lennox (born 29 November 1996)
IV) Lady Eloise Cordelia Gordon-Lennox (born 10 March 2000)
V) The Hon. Frederick Lysander Gordon-Lennox (born 10 March 2000)
In January 2016 he and Lady March were attacked and tied up in a major jewel robbery at Goodwood.[2]
