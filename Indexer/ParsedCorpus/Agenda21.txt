Agenda 21 is a non-binding, voluntarily implemented action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development.[1] It is a product of the Earth Summit (UN Conference on Environment and Development) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. It is an action agenda for the UN, other multilateral organizations, and individual governments around the world that can be executed at local, national, and global levels. The "21" in Agenda21 refers to the 21stCentury. It has been affirmed and had a few modifications at subsequent UNconferences.

Structure and contents[edit]
Agenda21 is a 350-page document divided into 40chapters that have been grouped into 4sections:
SectionI: Social and Economic Dimensions: is directed toward combating poverty, especially in developing countries, changing consumption patterns, promoting health, achieving a more sustainable population, and sustainable settlement in decision making.
SectionII: Conservation and Management of Resources for Development: Includes atmospheric protection, combating deforestation, protecting fragile environments, conservation of biological diversity (biodiversity), control of pollution and the management of biotechnology, and radioactive wastes.
SectionIII: Strengthening the Role of Major Groups: includes the roles of children and youth, women, NGOs, local authorities, business and industry, and workers; and strengthening the role of indigenous peoples, their communities, and farmers.
SectionIV: Means of Implementation: implementation includes science, technology transfer, education, international institutions and financial mechanisms.
Development and evolution[edit]
The full text of Agenda21 was made public at the UNConference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit), held in Rio de Janeiro on June 13, 1992, where 178governments voted to adopt the program. The final text was the result of drafting, consultation, and negotiation, beginning in 1989 and culminating at the two-week conference.
Rio+5 (1997)[edit]
In 1997, the UNGeneral Assembly held a special session to appraise the status of Agenda21 (Rio +5). The Assembly recognized progress as "uneven" and identified key trends, including increasing globalization, widening inequalities in income, and continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly Resolution (S-19/2) promised further action.
Rio+10 (2002)[edit]
Main article: World Summit on Sustainable Development
The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit2002), affirmed UN commitment to "full implementation" of Agenda21, alongside achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other international agreements.
Agenda21 for culture (2002)[edit]
Main article: Agenda 21 for culture
The first World Public Meeting on Culture, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2002, came up with the idea to establish guidelines for local cultural policies, something comparable to what Agenda21 was for the environment.[2] They are to be included in various subsections of Agenda21 and will be carried out through a wide range of sub-programs beginning with G8countries.[citation needed]
Rio+20 (2012)[edit]
Main article: United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development
In 2012, at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development the attending members reaffirmed their commitment to Agenda21 in their outcome document called "The Future We Want". 180 leaders from nations participated.
Implementation[edit]
The Commission on Sustainable Development acts as a high-level forum on sustainable development and has acted as preparatory committee for summits and sessions on the implementation of Agenda21. The UNDivision for Sustainable Development acts as the secretariat to the Commission and works "within the context of" Agenda21.
Implementation by member states remains voluntary, and its adoption has varied.
Local level[edit]
See also: International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives
The implementation of Agenda21 was intended to involve action at international, national, regional and local levels. Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally, as recommended in Chapter28 of the document. These programs are often known as "Local Agenda 21" or "LA21".[3] For example, in the Philippines, the plan is "Philippines Agenda21" (PA21). The group, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, formed in 1990; today its members come from over 1,000cities, towns, and counties in 88countries and is widely regarded as a paragon of Agenda21 implementation.[4]
In other countries[which?], opposition to Agenda 21's ideas has surfaced to varied extents. In some cases, opposition has been legislated into several States limiting or forbidding the participation and/or funding of local government activities that support Agenda 21.[5]
Europe turned out to be the continent where LA21 was best accepted and most implemented.[6] In Sweden, for example, all local governments have implemented a Local Agenda 21 initiative.[7]
National level[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2012)
The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs' Division for Sustainable Development monitors and evaluates progress, nation by nation, towards the adoption of Agenda21, and makes these reports available to the public on its website.[8]
Australia, for example, is a signatory to Agenda21 and 88 of its municipalities subscribe to ICLEI, an organization that promotes Agenda21 globally. Australia's membership is second only to that of the United States.[9] European countries generally possess well documented Agenda21 statuses. France, whose national government, along with 14cities, is a signatory, boasts nationwide programs supporting Agenda21. The French activist group Nouvelle Force announced in March 2012 that they viewed Agenda21 as a "sham".[10]
In Africa, national support for Agenda21 is strong and most countries are signatories. But support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country; for example, in 2002 Sam Nujoma, who was then President of Namibia, spoke about the importance of adhering to Agenda21 at the 2002 Earth Summit, noting that as a semi-arid country, Namibia sets a lot of store in the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).[11] Furthermore, there is little mention of Agenda21 at the local level in indigenous media. Only major municipalities in sub-Saharan African countries are members of ICLEI. Agenda21 participation in North African countries mirrors that of Middle Eastern countries, with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa generally have poorly documented Agenda21 status reports.[citation needed] By contrast, South Africa's participation in Agenda21 mirrors that of modern Europe, with 21city members of ICLEI and support of Agenda21 by national-level government.[citation needed]
Specific countries[edit]

United States[edit]
The national focal point in the United States is the Division Chief for Sustainable Development and Multilateral Affairs, Office of Environmental Policy, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, U.S. Department of State.[12] A June 2012 poll of 1,300 United States voters by the American Planning Association found that 9% supported Agenda 21, 6% opposed it, and 85% thought they didn't have enough information to form an opinion.[13]
Support[edit]
The United States is a signatory country to Agenda21, but because Agenda21 is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty, the United States Senate did not hold a formal debate or vote on it. It is therefore not considered to be law under Article Six of the United States Constitution. President George H. W. Bush was one of the 178 heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the Earth Summit in 1992,[14][15] and in the same year Representatives Nancy Pelosi, Eliot Engel and William Broomfield spoke in support of United States House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution 353, supporting implementation of Agenda21 in the United States.[13][16] Created by a 1993 Executive Order, the President's Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD) is explicitly charged with recommending a national action plan for sustainable development to the President. The PCSD is composed of leaders from government and industry, as well as from environmental, labor and civil rights organizations. The PCSD submitted its report, "Sustainable America: A New Consensus", to the President in early 1996. In the absence of a multi-sectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the United States, the PCSD was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of Agenda 21.
In the United States, over 528cities are members of ICLEI, an international sustainability organization that helps to implement the Agenda21 and Local Agenda21 concepts across the world. The United States has nearly half of the ICLEI's global membership of 1,200cities promoting sustainable development at a local level.[9] The United States also has one of the most comprehensively documented Agenda21 status reports.[17] In response to the opposition, Don Knapp, U.S. spokesman for the ICLEI, has said "Sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the U.N., but a bottom-up push from local governments".[13]
The Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry successfully lobbied against an anti-sustainable development bill in 2012, arguing "It would be bad for business" as it could drive away corporations that have embraced sustainable development.[13]
Opposition[edit]
During the last decade, opposition to Agenda21 has increased within the United States at the local, state, and federal levels.[18] The Republican National Committee has adopted a resolution opposing Agenda 21, and the Republican Party platform stated that "We strongly reject the U.N. Agenda 21 as erosive of American sovereignty."[19][20] Several state and local governments have considered or passed motions and legislation opposing Agenda21.[4][13][21][22][23][24] Alabama became the first state to prohibit government participation in Agenda21.[5] Many other states, including Arizona, are drafting, and close to passing legislation to ban Agenda 21.[25]
Activists, some of whom have been associated with the Tea Party movement by The New York Times and The Huffington Post, have said that Agenda21 is a conspiracy by the United Nations to deprive individuals of property rights.[4][13] Columnists in The Atlantic have linked opposition to Agenda 21 to the property rights movement in the United States.[13][26] In 2012 Glenn Beck co-wrote a dystopian novel titled Agenda 21 based in part on concepts discussed in the UN plan.[27][28][29]
