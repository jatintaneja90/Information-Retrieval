PacifiCorp is an electric power company in the western United States.
PacifiCorp has three operating divisions:
Pacific Power is a regulated electric utility with service territory throughout Oregon, northern California, and southeastern Washington.
Rocky Mountain Power is a regulated electric utility with service territory throughout Utah, Wyoming, and southeastern Idaho.
PacifiCorp Transmission operates one of the largest privately held transmission systems in the U.S. within the western Energy Imbalance Market.
In 2001, PacifiCorp was purchased by Scottish Power. Since 2006, PacifiCorp has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly MidAmerican), itself an affiliate of Berkshire Hathaway.
PacifiCorp is currently headquartered in the Lloyd Center Tower[4] at 825 N.E. Multnomah Street, Portland, Oregon, in the Lloyd District. Pacific Power is also headquartered in the same building. Rocky Mountain Power is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power combined serve over 1.6 million residential customers, 202,000 commercial customers, and 37,000 industrial and irrigation customers - for a total of approximately 1,813,000 customers. The service area is 143,000 square miles (370,000km2). The company owns and maintain 16,500 miles (26,600km) of long distance transmission lines, 64,000 miles (103,000km) of distribution lines, and 900 substations.
In 1977, PacifiCorp spun off its coal mining interests into a mining company known as NERCO, which was eventually listed on the New York Stock Exchange and ranked as high as 353 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest American companies. Through its majority interest in NERCO, PacifiCorp was involved in the mining of coal, oil, natural gas, gold, silver, and uranium. PacifiCorp still owned 82% of NERCO in 1993, when it was acquired by the mining giant, the Rio Tinto Group.[5]

Organization[edit]
PacifiCorp was formed in 1910 from the merger of several small electric companies in eastern Oregon and Washington to form the Pacific Power & Light Company. It gradually expanded its reach to include most of Oregon, as well as portions of California, Washington and Wyoming. In 1984, it reorganized itself as a holding company, PacifiCorp, headquartered in Portland with Pacific Power as its main subsidiary.
In 1987, PacifiCorp acquired Utah Power & Light. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah Power had been formed in 1912 from the merger of four electric companies in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming. In 1881, one of those companies made Salt Lake City the fifth city in the world with central station electricity.
After the merger, Pacific Power and Utah Power operated as divisions of PacifiCorp. In a July 2006 reorganization, Pacific Power's territory in central and eastern Wyoming was merged with the Utah Power territory to form Rocky Mountain Power.[6]

History[edit]
Utah Power and Light (UP&L) was organized on 6 September 1912 as a subsidiary of a large holding company, Electric Bond and Share Company (EBASCO) of New York. Within four years of its organization, UP&L had purchased twenty-seven other electric companies in the general Utah area, and eventually absorbed more than one hundred thirty.
Pacific Power & Light was formed in 1910 from the merger of several financially troubled utilities in Oregon and Washington. In 1954, Pacific Power & Light merged with the Mountain States Power Company, essentially doubling the company's service area. In 1961, the company purchased the California Oregon Power Company, extending its service into southern Oregon and northern California [8]
PacifiCorp Energy[edit]
PacifiCorp Energy was created after the purchase of PacifiCorp by MidAmerican Energy Holdings (now known as Berkshire Hathaway Energy). PacifiCorp Energy owns, maintains and operates the PacifiCorp generation assets and manages the commercial and trading operations of the company. PacifiCorp Energy owns 68 generating plants with a capacity of 9,140 megawatts. 70.6% of the generation is from thermal sources (i.e., coal or natural gas), 6.7% from hydroelectric sources, and 0.2% from renewable sources. 22.5% of PacifiCorp Energy's generation is purchased from other suppliers or under contracts.
