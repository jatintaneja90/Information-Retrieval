SeaGen is the world's first large scale commercial tidal stream generator.[1][2][3] It was four times more powerful than any other tidal stream generator in the world at the time of installation.[4]
The first SeaGen generator was installed in Strangford Narrows between Strangford and Portaferry in Northern Ireland, UK in April 2008 and was connected to the grid in July 2008.[5] It generates 1.2MW for between 18 and 20hours a day while the tides are forced in and out of Strangford Lough through the Narrows.[6] Strangford Lough was also the site of the very first known tide mill in the world, the Nendrum Monastery mill where remains dating from 787 have been excavated.

Background[edit]
The SeaGen rotors can be raised above the surface for maintenance.
SeaGen's predecessor, the 300kW 'SeaFlow' turbine off the north coast of Devon
Marine Current Turbines, the developer of SeaGen, demonstrated first prototype of tidal stream generator in 1994 with a 15kilowatt system in Loch Linnhe, off the west coast of Scotland. In May 2003, the prototype for SeaGen, 'SeaFlow', was installed off the coast of Lynmouth, North Devon, England.[6] Seaflow was a single rotor turbine which generated 300kW but was not connected to the grid. SeaFlow was the world's first offshore tidal generator, and remained the world's largest until SeaGen was installed.[7]
Technology[edit]
SeaGen generator weighs 300tonnes.[3][8] each driving a generator through a gearbox like a hydro-electric or wind turbine. These turbines have a patented feature by which the rotor blades can be pitched through 180degrees allowing them to operate in both flow directions  on ebb and flood tides. The company claims a capacity factor of 0.59 (average of the last 2000 hours). The power units of each system are mounted on arm-like extensions either side of a tubular steel monopile some 3 metres (9.8ft) in diameter and the arms with the power units can be raised above the surface for safe and easy maintenance access.[1] The SeaGen was built at Belfast's Harland and Wolff's shipyards.[9]
Environmental impact[edit]
400million gallons of water flow in and out of Strangford Lough twice a day.
SeaGen has been licensed to operate over a period of 5years, during which there will be a comprehensive environmental monitoring programme to determine the precise impact on the marine environment.[10]
Problems[edit]
During the commissioning of the system a software error caused the blades of one of the turbines to be damaged. This left the turbine operating at half power until autumn 2008. The incident is being investigated and MCT is confident that it will not happen again.[11] Full power operation was finally achieved on 18 Dec 2008.[12]
