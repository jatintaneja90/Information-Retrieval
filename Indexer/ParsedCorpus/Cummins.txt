History[edit]

Columbus main plant (1973)
The Cummins Engine Company was founded in 1919 by namesake Clessie Cummins, an Indiana mechanic. The Columbus, Indiana company focused on developing the engine invented 20 years earlier by Rudolf Diesel, but in spite of several well publicized endurance trials, it was not until 1933 that they introduced the successful Model H, used in small railroad switchers.[5][6][7] In the post World War II U.S. road building boom Cummins, with their N Series engines, became the leader in heavy duty truck engines, from 1952 to 1959 they had more than half the market.[8] In the 1960s the company opened an assembly plant in Shotts, Scotland. By 2013 they had operations in 197 countries and territories.[7]
Business units[edit]
Cummins Engine Business[edit]
Cummins Engine Business Unit consists of Aftermarket support, Mid-Range, Heavy-Duty, and High-Horsepower Engines. Cummins manufactures and markets a complete line of diesel and natural gas-powered engines for on-highway and off-highway use. Its markets include heavy-and medium-duty truck, bus, recreational vehicle (RV), light-duty automotive and a number of industrial uses including, construction, mining, marine, oil and gas, railroad and military equipment.[2]
For the general public, the most visible Cummins product may be the 5.9-liter in-line six-cylinder engine used in the Dodge Ram light duty pickups starting in 1989.[9] In 2007, a 6.7-liter version of the Cummins straight six engine became optional on the RAM pickup.[9] In 2008, Cummins was a named defendant in a class action suit related to 1998-2001 model year Chrysler Dodge Ram trucks, model 2500 or 3500, originally equipped with a Cummins ISB 5.9 liter diesel engine built using a pattern 53 Block.[10] The case has been settled, but some qualified Chrysler owners may receive $500 for repairs to the block, which was alleged to crack and create a coolant leak.
In April 2013, Cummins utilized technology developed by Westport Innovations to begin shipping large natural gas fueled engines to truck manufacturers in the United States as trucking companies began converting portions of their fleets to natural gas and the natural gas distribution network in the United States began to expand.[11]
Cummins Power Generation Business (formerly Onan)[edit]

Cummins is a global provider of power generation systems, components and services in standby power, distributed power generation, as well as auxiliary power in mobile applications to meet the needs of a diversified customer base.

With regards to Turbo Technologies, Cummins designs and manufactures turbochargers and related products, on a global scale, for diesel engines above 3 liters. In regards to Emission Solutions, Cummins develops and supplies catalytic exhaust systems and related products to the medium-and heavy-duty commercial diesel engine markets. In regards to Filtration, Cummins designs, manufactures and distributes heavy-duty and light-duty air, fuel, hydraulic and lube filtration, chemicals and exhaust system technology products for diesel and gas-powered equipment. With regards to Electronics, Cummins designs engine control units and sensors for Cummins diesel engines.

Cummins Turbo Technologies[edit]
The Holset Engineering Co. was a British company that produced turbochargers, primarily for diesel and heavy duty application
In 1973 the company was purchased by Cummins after briefly being owned by the Hanson Trust. Holset now operates facilities in China, India, Brazil, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
In 2006, the division officially changed its name to Cummins Turbo Technologies to be identified more closely with its parent company. The turbocharger products still use the Holset brand name.
Cummins Power Generation[edit]
In 1986, Cummins began acquisition of Onan and completed it in 1992. Since then, Onan has evolved into Cummins Power Generation, a wholly invested division of Cummins. The Onan name continues to be used for modern versions of their traditional engine-driven generators for RV, marine, commercial mobility, home standby, and portable use.
Cummins Emission Solutions[edit]
Exhaust and emissions after-treatment company Nelson Industries was purchased in 1999, due to the increasing importance of exhaust after-treatment systems for meeting future emissions standards. The division officially changed its name to Cummins Emission Solutions, in order to be identified more closely with their parent company.
India operations[edit]
Cummins began its India operations on 17 February 1962 in a joint venture with the Kirloskar Group. The ownership structure of the joint venture was divided as follows:
Cummins - 50%
Kirloskar Group - 25.5%
Retail Investors - 24.5%
As of 2013, the Cummins group had revenues of over $1.5 billion, 20 factories and 9000 employees in India.
Cummins does a significant part of its R&D in India at the Cummins Research and Technology centre that was set up in 2003. Also, Cummins is building an advanced technical centre in Pune which will house over 2000 engineers.[12]
Cummins India has also made significant contributions to local skill development by establishing the MKSSS's Cummins College of Engineering for Women, a women-only engineering college in Pune.[13]
