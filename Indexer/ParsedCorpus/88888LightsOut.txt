Campaign organisation[edit]
The campaign was started by Exnora International,[2] a non-governmental organisation in India. It called for people to switch off their lights for eight minutes at 8 p.m. on August 8, 2008 (8-8-8-8-8) to spread awareness and take action to reduce energy consumption and the resulting environmental damage.[3]
In the city of Chennai, Governor Surjit Singh Barnala ordered the lights off in Raj Bhavan at 8 p.m. for 8 minutes and said that an awakening should be created among the people of all walks of life on the root cause of global warming, it occurred at the very beginning of the 2008 Olympics.[4]
The effort has been part of a wider effort by the groups involved to bring attention to environmental issues.[2]
