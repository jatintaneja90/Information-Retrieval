Wind power[edit]
Main article: Wind power in Greece
Wind power was due to expand[when?] by 352% by 2010 to meet the European target of 20% coverage of energy needs from renewable sources. Previously,[when?] there were 1,028 wind turbines installed throughout Greece and the number was set to reach 2,587 wind turbines before the end of 2010.[3]
According to the Ministry of Environment and Public Works, the system would have a nameplate capacity of 3,372 MW of power from wind alone[when?] compared to 746 MW at the end of 2006.[4] Greece chose to invest primarily to wind power by 77%, while the rest of renewable sources altogether comprise the remaining 23% of production with hydroelectric power being second with 11%.[5][6]
Solar power[edit]

Solar insolation in Greece
The solar energy development in Greece started in 2006 and increased substantially from 2009 because of the high feed-in tariffs introduced and the corresponding regulations for domestic applications of PVs on rooftops.[citation needed] However this mechanism overheated the market creating a big deficit of more than 500 million euros in the Greek "Operator of Electricity Market".[citation needed]
From August 2012 new regulations have been introduced including a temporary tax imposed to all operating PV plants (excluding residential applications), licensing of new PV projects have been put on halt and the feed-in tariffs were drastically reduced.[7]
As of December 2013, the total installed photovoltaic capacity in Greece reached 2,419.2 MWp [8] of which 987.2 MWp were installed in the period between JanuarySeptember 2013 despite the financial crisis.[9] Greece ranks 5th worldwide with regard to per capita installed PV capacity. It is expected that PV produced energy will cover up to 7% of the country's electricity demand in 2014.[10]
