Velomobile, the most efficient means of passenger transportation
Energy efficiency in transportation is, strictly speaking, useful output (kilometers, miles, etc.) divided by total energy input (kilowatt-hour, amount of gasoline, etc.). This is more precisely known as fuel economy (symbol FE), and may be measured in units of km/L or mi/gal (MPG).[1][2]
Energy efficiency in transportation is often (and confusingly) described in terms of fuel consumption (symbol FC). Fuel consumption is the reciprocal of fuel economy[2] and is occasionally known as energy intensity;[3] it equals fuel (energy) divided by distance, and is often measured in units of liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km), joules per kilometer (J/km), gallon-equivalent per 100 miles (gale/100mi), or kilowatt-hours per distance (kW-hr/km or kW-hr/mi).
The energy efficiency in transportation varies by mode of transportation (listed below). Different types of transportation range from some hundred kilojoules per kilometre (kJ/km) for a bicycle to tens of megajoules per kilometer (MJ/km) for a helicopter.

Units of measurement[edit]
Both fuel economy and fuel consumption are often given on a per-vehicle basis. More refined units of measurement exist, such as fuel consumption per passenger or fuel consumption per mass of cargo.
Energy efficiency is expressed in terms of fuel economy:[2]
distance per vehicle per unit fuel volume; e.g., km/L or miles per gallon (US or imperial).
distance per vehicle per unit fuel mass; e.g., km/kg.[4]
distance per vehicle per unit energy; e.g., miles per gallon equivalent (mpg-e).
Energy intensity (reciprocal efficiency)[3] is expressed terms of fuel consumption:[2]
volume of fuel (or total energy) consumed per unit distance per vehicle; e.g. L/100km or MJ/100km.
volume of fuel (or total energy) consumed per unit distance per passenger; e.g., L/(100passengerkm).
volume of fuel (or total energy) consumed per unit distance per unit mass of cargo transported; e.g., L/100kgkm or MJ/tkm.
electricity used per vehicle per unit distance; e.g., kWh/100km.
Transportation types[edit]
For freight transport, rail and ship transport are generally much more efficient than trucking, and air freight is much less efficient.[5][6]
Walking[edit]
Nordic walkers
A 68kg (150lb) person walking at 4km/h (2.5mph) requires approximately 210 kilocalories (880kJ) of food energy per hour, which is equivalent to 4.55km/MJ.[7] 1USgal (3.8L) of gasoline contains about 114,000 British thermal units (120MJ)[8] of energy, so this is approximately equivalent to 360 miles per US gallon (0.65L/100km).
Velomobile[edit]
Main article: Velomobile
Velomobiles seem to have the highest energy efficiency in personal transportation. At a speed of 50km/h (31mph) the WAW manufacturer claims they need only 0.5kWh of food energy per 100km to transport the passenger, which is around 15 (20%) of a normal bicycle, and 150 (2%) of an average fossil fuel or electric car. This corresponds to 4700 miles per US gallon (2000km/L, 0.05L/100km).[9] Other sources give a figure of 13.4 (29.5%) of the energy use of a normal bicycle.[10]
Bicycling[edit]
A Chinese Flying Pigeon bicycle
A relatively light and slow vehicle with low-friction tires and an efficient chain-driven drivetrain, the bicycle is one of the most energy-efficient forms of transport. Compared with walking, a 64kg (140lb) cyclist riding at 16km/h (10mph) requires about half the food energy per unit distance: 43kcal/mi, 27kcal/km or 3.1kWh (11MJ) per 100km.[7] This converts to about 732mpg-US (0.321L/100km; 879mpg-imp).[11] This figure depends on the speed and mass of the rider: greater speeds give higher air drag and heavier riders consume more energy per unit distance.
A motorized bicycle allows human power and the assistance of a 49cm3 (3.0cuin) engine, giving a range of 160to 200mpg-US (1.51.2L/100km; 190240mpg-imp).[citation needed] Electric pedal-assisted bikes run on as little as 1.0kWh (3.6MJ) per 100km,[citation needed] while maintaining speeds in excess of 30km/h (19mph).[citation needed] These best-case figures rely on a human doing 70% of the work, with around 3.6MJ (1.0kWh) per 100km coming from the motor.
Human power[edit]
To be thorough, a comparison must also consider the energy costs of producing, transporting and packaging of fuel (food or fossil fuel), the energy incurred in disposing of exhaust waste, and the energy costs of manufacturing the vehicle. This last can be significant given that walking requires little or no special equipment, while automobiles, for example, require a great deal of energy to produce and have relatively short lifespans. In addition, any comparison of electric vehicles and liquid-fuelled vehicles must include the fuel consumed in the power station to generate the electricity. In the UK for instance the efficiency of the electricity generation and distribution system is around 0.40.
Automobiles[edit]

Bugatti Veyron
Automobile fuel efficiency is most commonly expressed in terms of the volume of fuel consumed per one hundred kilometres (L/100km), but in some countries (including the USA, UK and India) it is more commonly expressed in terms of the distance per volume fuel consumed (km/L or miles per US or imperial gallon). This is complicated by the different energy content of fuels such as petrol and diesel. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) states that the energy content of unleaded gasoline is 115,000 British thermal unit (BTU) per US gallon (32MJ/L) compared to 130,500 BTU per US gallon (36.4MJ/L) for diesel.[12]
A second important consideration is the energy costs of producing energy. Bio-fuels, electricity and hydrogen, for instance, have significant energy inputs in their production. Because of this, the 5070% efficiency of hydrogen production has to be combined with the vehicle efficiency to yield net efficiency.[13]
A third consideration to take into account is the occupancy rate of the vehicle. As the number of passengers per vehicle increases the consumption per unit distance per vehicle increases. However this increase is slight compared to the reduction in consumption per unit distance per passenger. We can compare, for instance, the estimated average occupancy rate of about 1.3 passengers per car in the San Francisco Bay Area[14] to the 2006 UK estimated average of 1.58.[15]
Finally, vehicle energy efficiency calculations would be misleading without factoring the energy cost of producing the vehicle itself. This initial energy cost can of course be depreciated over the life of the vehicle to calculate an average energy efficiency over its effective life span. In other words, vehicles that take a lot of energy to produce and are used for relatively short periods will require a great deal more energy over their effective lifespan than those that do not, and are therefore much less energy efficient than they may otherwise seem. Compare, for example, walking, which requires no special equipment at all, and an automobile, produced in and shipped from another country, and made from parts manufactured around the world from raw materials and minerals mined and processed elsewhere again, and used for a limited number of years.
Driving practices and vehicles can be modified to improve their energy efficiency by about 15%.[16][17]
Example consumption figures[edit]
Two American solar cars in Canada
Solar cars use no fuel, charging the batteries entirely from built-in solar panels, and typically use less than 3kWh per 100miles (67kJ/km or 1.86kWh/100km).[18]
The four passenger GEM NER uses 169Wh/mi (203mpg-e; 10.5kWh/100km),[19] which equates to 2.6kWh/100km per person when fully occupied, albeit at only 24mph (39km/h).
The General Motors EV1 was rated in a test with a charging efficiency of 373 Wh-AC/mile or 23 kWh/100km[20] approximately equivalent to 2.6L/100km (110mpg-imp; 90mpg-US) for petroleum-fuelled vehicles.
Chevrolet Volt in full electric mode uses 36 kilowatt-hours per 100 miles (810kJ/km; 96mpg-e), meaning it may be more energy-efficient than walking for 4 or more passengers.
The Daihatsu Charade 993cc turbo diesel (19871993) won the most fuel efficient vehicle award for going round the United Kingdom consuming an average of 2.82L/100km (100mpg-imp). It was surpassed only recently by the VW Lupo 3L which consumes about 2.77L/100km (102mpg-imp). Both cars are rare to find on the popular market. The Daihatsu had major problems with rust and structural safety which contributes to its rarity and the quite short production run.
The Volkswagen Polo 1.4 TDI Bluemotion and the SEAT Ibiza 1.4 TDI Ecomotion, both rated at 3.8L/100km (74mpg-imp; 62mpg-US) (combined) were the most fuel efficient cars on sale in the UK as of 22 March 2008.[21][22][23][needs update]
Honda Insight  achieves 48mpg-US (4.9L/100km; 58mpg-imp) under real-world conditions.[24]
Honda Civic Hybrid- regularly averages around 45mpg-US (5.2L/100km; 54mpg-imp).
Toyota Prius  According to the US EPA's revised estimates, the combined fuel consumption for the 2008 Prius is 46mpg-US (5.1L/100km; 55mpg-imp),[25] making it the most fuel efficient United States car of 2008.[26] In the UK, the official fuel consumption figure (combined) for the Prius is 4.3L/100km (66mpg-imp; 55mpg-US).[27]
2012 Cadillac CTS-V Wagon 6.2L Supercharged, 14mpg-US (17L/100km; 17mpg-imp).[28]
2012 Bugatti Veyron, 10mpg-US (24L/100km; 12mpg-imp).[28]
Aircraft[edit]
Main articles: Fuel economy in aircraft and Environmental impact of aviation
Solar Impulse 2, a solar aircraft
A principal determinant of energy consumption in aircraft is drag, which must be opposed by thrust for the aircraft to progress.
Drag is proportional to the lift required for flight,[29] which is equal to the weight of the aircraft. As induced drag increases with weight, mass reduction, with improvements in engine efficiency and reductions in aerodynamic drag, has been a principal source of efficiency gains in aircraft, with a rule-of-thumb being that a 1% weight reduction corresponds to around a 0.75% reduction in fuel consumption.[29]
Flight altitude affects engine efficiency. Jet-engine efficiency increases at altitude up to the tropopause, the temperature minimum of the atmosphere; at lower temperatures, the Carnot efficiency is higher.[29] Jet engine efficiency is also increased at high speeds, but above about Mach 0.85 the airframe aerodynamic losses increase faster.
Compressibility effects: beginning at transonic speeds of around Mach 0.85, shockwaves form increasing drag.
For supersonic flight, it is difficult to achieve a lift to drag ratio greater than 5, and fuel consumption is increased in proportion.

Passenger airplanes averaged 4.8 l/100km per passenger (1.4 MJ/passenger-km) (49 passenger-miles per gallon) in 1998.[citation needed] Note that on average 20% of seats are left unoccupied. Jet aircraft efficiencies are improving: Between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55% overall fuel efficiency gain (if one were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the DH Comet 4 and to consider the Boeing 707 as the base case).[32] Most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use. Compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s, current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile.[33] Between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4%. Concorde the supersonic transport managed about 17 passenger-miles to the Imperial gallon; similar to a business jet, but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft. Airbus puts the fuel rate consumption of their A380 at less than 3 l/100km per passenger (78 passenger-miles per US gallon).[34]
Air France Airbus A380-800
The mass of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as titanium, carbon fiber and other composite plastics. Expensive materials may be used, if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency. The improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction, reduces the amount of fuel that needs to be carried. This further reduces the mass of the aircraft and therefore enables further gains in fuel efficiency. For example, the Airbus A380 design includes multiple light-weight materials.
Airbus has showcased wingtip devices (sharklets or winglets) that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption.[35][36] There are wingtip devices on the Airbus A380. Further developed Minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption.[37] Winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing smooth out the wing-tip vortex (reducing the aircraft's wing drag) and can be retrofitted to any airplane.[37]
NASA and Boeing are conducting tests on a 500lb (230kg) "blended wing" aircraft. This design allows for greater fuel efficiency since the whole craft produces lift, not just the wings.[38] The blended wing body (BWB) concept offers advantages in structural, aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over today's more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs. These features translate into greater range, fuel economy, reliability and life cycle savings, as well as lower manufacturing costs.[39][40] NASA has created a cruise efficient STOL (CESTOL) concept.
Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Applied Materials Research (IFAM) have researched a shark skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect.[41] Aircraft are a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium metal foam and nanotechnology such as the shark skin imitating paint.
Propfan propulsors are a more fuel efficient technology than jets or turboprops, but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450mph (700km/h).[42] This speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today. However, the decrease in speed reduces drag. With the current [needs update] high price for jet fuel and the emphasis on engine/airframe efficiency to reduce emissions, there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350XWB. For instance, Airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans.[43] NASA has conducted an Advanced Turboprop Project (ATP), where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds.
Related to fuel efficiency is the impact of aviation emissions on climate.
Small aircraft[edit]
Dyn'Aro MCR4S
Motor-gliders made of composite materials can reach an extremely low fuel consumption for cross-country flights, using thermal air currents and winds.
At 160km/h, a diesel powered two-seater Dieselis burns 6 liters of fuel per hour, 1.9 liters per 100 passenger km.[44]
at 220km/h, a four-seater 100hp MCR-4S burns 20 liters of gas per hour, 2.2 liters per 100 passenger km.
Under continuous motorised flight at 225km/h, a Pipistrel Sinus burns 11 liters of fuel per flight hour. Carrying 2 people aboard, it operates at 2.4 liters per 100 passenger km.
Ultralight aircraft Tecnam P92 Echo Classic at cruise speed of 185km/h burns 17 liters of fuel per flight hour, 4.6 liters per 100 passenger km (2 people).[45] Other modern ultralight aircraft have increased efficiency; Tecnam P2002 Sierra RG at cruise speed of 237km/h burns 17 liters of fuel per flight hour, 3.6 liters per 100 passenger km (2 people).[46]
Two-seater and four-seater flying at 250km/h with old generation engines can burn 25 to 40 liters per flight hour, 3 to 5 liters per 100 passenger km.
The Sikorsky S-76C++ twin turbine helicopter gets about 1.65mpg-US (143L/100km; 1.98mpg-imp) at 140 knots (260km/h; 160mph) and carries 12 for about 19.8 passenger-miles per gallon (11.9 L per 100 passenger km).[citation needed]
Ships[edit]
Queen Elizabeth[edit]
RMSQueen Elizabeth 2
Cunard states that RMSQueen Elizabeth 2 travels 49.5 feet per imperial gallon of diesel oil (3.32m/l or 41.2ft/USgal), and that it has a passenger capacity of 1777.[47] Thus carrying 1777 passengers we can calculate an efficiency of 16.7 passenger miles per imperial gallon (16.9l/100pkm or 13.9pmpgUS).
Cruise ships[edit]
MSOasis of the Seas has a capacity of 6,296 passengers and a fuel efficiency of 14.4 passenger miles per US gallon. Voyager-class cruise ships have a capacity of 3,114 passengers and a fuel efficiency of 12.8 passenger miles per US gallon.[48]
Emma Maersk[edit]
Emma Maersk uses a Wrtsil-Sulzer RTA96-C, which consumes 163g/kWh and 13,000kg/h. If it carries 13,000 containers then 1kg fuel transports one container for one hour over a distance of 45km. The ship takes 18 days from Tanjung (Singapore) to Rotterdam (Netherlands), 11 from Tanjung to Suez, and 7 from Suez to Rotterdam,[49] which is roughly 430 hours, and has 80MW, +30MW. 18 days at a mean speed of 25 knots (46km/h) gives a total distance of 10,800 nautical miles (20,000km).
Sailboats[edit]
A sailboat, much like a solar car, can locomote without consuming any fuel. A sail boat such as a Dinghy using just wind power requires no input energy in terms of fuel. However some manual energy is required by the crew to steer the boat and adjust the sails using ropes. In addition energy will be needed for demands other than propulsion, such as cooking, heating or lighting. The fuel efficiency of a single-occupancy boat is highly dependent on the size of its engine, the speed at which it travels, and its displacement. Due to the high viscosity of water, with a single passenger, the equivalent energy efficiency will be lower than in a car, train, or plane.
Trains[edit]
Trains can be an efficient means of transport for freight and passengers. Efficiency varies significantly with passenger loads, and losses incurred in electricity generation and supply (for electrified systems),[50][51] and, importantly, end-to-end delivery, where stations are not the originating final destinations of a journey.
Actual consumption depends on gradients, maximum speeds, loading and stopping patterns. Data produced for the European MEET project (Methodologies for Estimating Air Pollutant Emissions) illustrate the different consumption patterns over several track sections. The results show the consumption for a German ICE high-speed train varied from around 19to 33kWh/km (68119MJ/km; 3153kWh/mi). The data also reflects the weight of the train per passenger. For example, TGV double-deck Duplex trains use lightweight materials, which keep axle loads down and reduce damage to track and also save energy.[52]

Considering only the energy spent to move the train, and taking as example the urban area of Lisbon, train seems to be on average 20 times more efficient than automobile for transportation of passengers, if we consider energy spent per passenger-km.[64] Considering an automobile which has a consumptions of around 6l/100km (47mpg-imp; 39mpg-US) of gasoline, the fact the on average cars in Europe have an occupation ratio of around 1.2 passengers per automobile and that one litre of gasoline amounts for about 8826 Wh, one gets on average 441Wh (1,590kJ) per passenger-km. On the other hand, a modern urban train with an average occupation of 20% of total capacity, which has a consumption of about 8.5kWh/km (31MJ/km; 13.7kWh/mi), one gets 21.5 Wh per passenger-km, 20 times less than the automobile.
Braking losses[edit]
Stopping is a considerable source of inefficiency. Modern electric trains like the Shinkansen (the Bullet Train) use regenerative braking to return current into the catenary while they brake. A Siemens study indicated that regenerative braking might recover 41.6% of the total energy consumed. The Passenger Rail (Urban and Intercity) and Scheduled Intercity and All Charter Bus Industries Technological and Operational Improvements  FINAL REPORT states that "Commuter operations can dissipate more than half of their total traction energy in braking for stops." and that "We estimate head-end power to be 35 percent (but it could possibly be as high as 45 percent) of total energy consumed by commuter railways."[65] Having to accelerate and decelerate a heavy train load of people at every stop is inefficient despite regenerative braking which can recover typically around 20% of the energy wasted in braking. Weight is a determinant of braking losses.

Buses[edit]
The Bus Rapid Transit of Metz uses a diesel-electric hybrid driving system, developed by Belgian Van Hool manufacturer.[66]
In July 2005, the average occupancy for buses in the UK was stated to be 9.[67]
The fleet of 244 40-foot (12m) 1982 New Flyer trolley buses in local service with BC Transit in Vancouver, Canada, in 1994/95 used 35,454,170kWh for 12,966,285 vehicle km, or 9.84 MJ/vehicle km. Exact ridership on trolleybuses is not known, but with all 34 seats filled this equates to 0.32 MJ/passenger km. It is quite common to see people standing on Vancouver trolleybuses. This is a service with many stops per kilometre; part of the reason for the efficiency is the use of regenerative braking.
A commuter service in Santa Barbara, California, USA, found average diesel bus efficiency of 6.0mpg-US (39L/100km; 7.2mpg-imp) (using MCI 102DL3 buses). With all 55 seats filled this equates to 330 passenger mpg; with 70% filled, 231 passenger mpg.[68]
In 2011 the fleet of 752 buses in the city of Lisbon had an average speed of 14.4km/h and an average occupancy of 20.1 passengers per vehicle.[69]
Other[edit]
NASA's Crawler-Transporter is used to move the Shuttle from storage to the launch pad. It uses diesel and has one of the highest fuel consumption rates on record, 150 US gallons per mile (350l/km; 120impgal/mi).[70]
International transport comparisons[edit]
UK Public transport[edit]
Rail and bus are generally required to serve 'off peak' and rural services, which by their nature have lower loads than city bus routes and inter city train lines. Moreover, due to their 'walk on' ticketing it is much harder to match daily demand and passenger numbers. As a consequence, the overall load factor on UK railways is 35% or 90 people per train:[71]
Conversely, Air services work on point-to-point networks between large population centres and are 'pre-book' in nature. Using yield management overall loads can be raised to around 7090%. However, recently intercity train operators have been using similar techniques, with loads reaching typically 71% overall for TGV services in France and a similar figure for the UK's Virgin Trains services.[72]
For emissions, the electricity generating source needs to be taken into account.[73][74] [75]

Compare:
Space Shuttle used to transport freight to the other side of the Earth (see above): 40 megajoules per tonne-kilometre.
Net energy for lifting: 10 megajoules per tonne-kilometre.
Canadian transportation[edit]
Natural Resources Canada's Office of Energy Efficiency publishes annual statistics regarding the efficiency of the entire Canadian fleet. For researchers, these fuel consumption estimates are more realistic than the fuel consumption ratings of new vehicles, as they represent the real world driving conditions, including extreme weather and traffic. The annual report is called Energy Efficiency Trends Analysis. There are dozens of tables illustrating trends in energy consumption expressed in energy per passenger km (passengers) or energy per tonne km (freight).[81]
French environmental calculator[edit]
The environmental calculator of the French environment and energy agency (ADEME) published in 2007 using data from 2005[82] enables one to compare the different means of transportation as regards the CO2 emissions (in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent) as well as the consumption of primary energy. In the case of an electric vehicle, the ADEME makes the assumption that 2.58toe as primary energy are necessary for producing one toe of electricity as end energy in France (see Embodied energy#Embodied energy in the energy field).
This computer tool devised by the ADEME shows the importance of public transportation from an environmental point of view. It highlights the primary energy consumption as well as the CO2 emissions due to transportation. However, nothing is said about the production of radioactive waste. Moreover, intermodal passenger transport is probably a key to sustainable transport, by allowing people to use less polluting means of transportation.
