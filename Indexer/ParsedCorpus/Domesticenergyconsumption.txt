Domestic energy consumption or domestic consumption of energy is the total amount of energy used in a house for household work. The amount of energy used per household varies widely depending on the standard of living of the country, the climate, and the age and type of residence.
In the United States as of 2008, in an average household in a temperate climate, the yearly use of household energy can be composed as follows:
Average domestic energy consumption per household in the United States
Heating
12000 kWh/yr (1400 watts)
Hot water
3000 kWh/yr (340 watts)
Cooling and refrigeration
1200 kWh/yr (140 watts)
Lighting
1200 kWh/yr (140 watts)
Washing and drying
1000 kWh/yr (110 watts)
Cooking
1000 kWh/yr (110 watts)
Miscellaneous electric load
600 kWh/yr (70 watts)
[1]
This equates to an average instantaneous power consumption of 2kW at any given time.
Households in different parts of the world will have differing levels of consumption, based on latitude and technology.
