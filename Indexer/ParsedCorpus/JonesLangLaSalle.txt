History and mergers[edit]
Jones Lang LaSalle was formed by the merger of Jones Lang Wootton, a British firm founded by Richard Winstanley in 1783, becoming Jones Lang & Company in 1872 after Frederick Jones forms a partnership with CA Lang and merging with Wootton a& Son in 1939 to form JLW, and LaSalle Partners, a US company formed from a predecessor launched in 1968.[2]
Jones Lang Wootton opened its first US office in New York in 1975. In 1997, the initial public offering was completed by LaSalle Partners for the company's common stock in the market.
JLW and LaSalle Partners formed Jones Lang LaSalle in 1999, which was the largest international merger in the real estate industry at the time.
Through a combination of organic growth and mergers and acquisitions the company has grown in recent years. Notable among over 35 M&As in the last decade are the 2007 transaction that created Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj,[3] the largest real estate firm in India, and the 2008 acquisition of The Staubach Company, which added about 1,000 employees in the U.S.[4]
In May 2011, Jones Lang LaSalle purchased King Sturge LLP for 197 million, making it the largest UK property adviser in the UK.[5]
In 2014 the organization shortened its name to JLL for marketing purposes, while the legal name remained Jones Lang LaSalle.[1]
In November 2015, the company announced that they're moving into the residential property market with the acquisition of Guardian Property Asset Management.[6]
In June 2016, the company announced they are moving into workplace technology and management with the acquisition of BRG.[7]
