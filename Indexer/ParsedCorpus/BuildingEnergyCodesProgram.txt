L. No 94-385),[1] as amended, and the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) (Pub. L. No 110-140).[1] These statutes direct DOE to participate in industry processes to develop model building energy codes, issue determinations as to whether updated codes result in energy savings, and provide technical assistance to states to implement and comply with the codes. The BECP is part of DOEs Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Building Technologies Office.

Program Areas[edit]
BECP focuse in three key building energy code areas: model code development, adoption, and compliance.[2]
Model Code Development[edit]
DOE is directed by statute to review the technical and economic basis of building energy codes and participate in processes for their review and modification, including adoption of all technologically feasible and economically justified energy efficiency measures.
Adoption[edit]
DOE is directed by statute to provide technical assistance to states implementing building energy codes, including the adoption of all technologically feasible and economically justified efficiency measures, as well as encouraging states to adopt updated building energy codes.
Compliance[edit]
DOE is directed by statute to provide technical assistance to states implementing energy codes.
