George Andrew Olah (born Olh Gyrgy; May 22, 1927) is a Hungarian and American chemist. His research involves the generation and reactivity of carbocations via superacids. For this research, Olah was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1994.[3] He has also been awarded the Priestley Medal, the highest honor granted by the American Chemical Society and F.A. Cotton Medal for Excellence in Chemical Research of the American Chemical Society in 1996.[4][5][6][7]

Education and early life[edit]
Olah was born in Budapest, Hungary, on May 22, 1927, to Magda (Krasznai) and Julius Olh, a lawyer.[8] After the high school of Budapesti Piarista Gimnazium (Scolopi fathers), he studied, then taught, at what is now Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
Career and research[edit]
As a result of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, he and his family moved briefly to England and then to Canada, where he joined Dow Chemical in Sarnia, Ontario, with another Hungarian chemist, Stephen J. Kuhn. Olah's pioneering work on carbocations started during his eight years with Dow.[9] In 1965 he returned to academia at Case Western Reserve University and then to the University of Southern California in 1977. In 1971, Olah became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
As of April 2016, Olah is a distinguished professor at the University of Southern California[10] and the director of the Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute. In 2005, Olah wrote an essay promoting the methanol economy.[11]
The Olah family formed an endowment fund (the George A. Olah Endowment) which grants annual awards to outstanding chemists. The awards are selected and administered by the American Chemical Society.[12]
The search for stable carbocations led to the discovery of protonated methane which was stabilized by superacids, like FSO3H-SbF5 ("Magic Acid").
CH4 + H+  CH5+
Olah was also involved in a career-long battle with Herbert C. Brown of Purdue over the existence of so-called "nonclassical" carbocations  such as the norbornyl cation, which can be depicted as cationic character delocalized over several bonds.
In recent years,[when?] his research has shifted from hydrocarbons and their transformation into fuel to the methanol economy. He has joined with Robert Zubrin, Anne Korin, and James Woolsey in promoting a flexible-fuel mandate initiative.[13][14][15]
Awards and honours[edit]
1970 ACS Henry Morley Medal[citation needed]
1989 California Scientist of the Year in 1989.[citation needed]
1993 Chemical Pioneer Award from the American Institute of Chemists [16]
1994 Nobel Prize [17]
1996 ACS F. A. Cotton Medal[18]
1997 Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1997.[1]
