Life and research activity[edit]
Armaroli studied chemistry at the University of Bologna and got his laurea in 1990. In 1994 he got his PhD under supervision of Vincenzo Balzani. After that he was a post-doc at Bowling Green State University and the Italian National Research Counsil. There he started his own research project in 1997 and consequently became a Senior Research Scientist in 2002. Since 2007 he is Research Director.
As of October 2014 he had published 168 papers in refereed scientific journals. Furthermore he is the author of five books and several book chapters. His H-index is 54, making him one of the leading Italian scientists.[2] Besides his research activity he is member of the Editorial Boards of Chemistry - A European Journal, Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences, Polyhedron, Frontiers in Inorganic Chemistry and director of SAPERE, the oldest Italian scientific journal, which was founded in 1935.
