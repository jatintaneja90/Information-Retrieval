Solar panels and wind turbines in Germany
This is a list of renewable energy topics by country. These links can be used to compare developments in renewable energy in different countries and to help and encourage new writers to participate in writing about developments in their own countries or countries of interest.
The list refers to renewable energy in general, as well as solar power, wind power, geothermal energy, biofuel, and hydro-electricity. As of 2013, China, Germany, and Japan, three of the world's four largest economies, as well as India, generate more electricity from renewables than from nuclear power.
Based on REN21's 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to humans' global energy consumption. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% is electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.
China is the world's largest producer of hydroelectricity, followed by Canada. Wind power capacity is growing at the rate of 26% annually, and is widely used in Europe, Asia, and the United States.[1] Wind power accounts for approximately 30% of electricity use in Denmark, 20% in Portugal, and 18% in Spain.[2]
PV power stations are popular in Japan, China and the United States. The world's largest geothermal power installation is The Geysers in California, with a rated capacity of 750 MW.[3] Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel.[4] Ethanol fuel is also widely available in the USA. Plug-in electric vehicles in Norway reached a market share of 22.4% in 2015.[5] the highest in the world.
While many renewable energy projects are large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development. Small solar PV systems provide electricity to a few million households, and micro-hydro configured into mini-grids serves many more.

About 520,000 highway legal light-duty plug-in electric vehicles were sold worldwide in 2015, with cumulative global sales reaching 1,235,000. The United States is the leading market with 411,120 units sold since 2008, followed by China with 258,328 units sold since 2011. Japan ranks third (about 130,000), followed by the Netherlands (88,991), Norway (77,897), France (74,291), and the UK (53,254). Four of these countries achieved a PEV market share over 1% of new car sales in 2015: Norway (22.39%), the Netherlands (9.74%), France (1.2%), and the UK (1.1%)
