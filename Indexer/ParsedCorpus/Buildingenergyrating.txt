A building energy rating (BER) is similar to the energy label for a household electrical appliance. The label has a scale of A-G, with A-rated buildings the most energy efficient and G the least. In relation to dwellings, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland states that "A BER is an indication of the energy performance of a home. It covers energy use for space heating, water heating, ventilation and lighting calculated on the basis of standard occupancy."[1] A BER assessment and certificate may be compulsory to sell a building or shortly after its construction. Methods of calculations and legislations related to BER may be different from one country to another. BER was created as a tool to help monitoring and improving the overall building energy efficiency.
Building Energy Rating in Ireland[edit]
In Ireland, each new dwelling built from January 1, 2007 required a BER, unless planning application was lodged prior to December 31, 2006. From January 1, 2009, it became illegal to offer a dwelling for sale without BER.
From July 1, 2008 a BER is necessary for new non-residential buildings where planning permission is required. From January 1, 2009 a BER is required for existing non-residential buildings, when offered for sale or to let.[2]
The Statutory Instrument regulating the requirements for BER is "S.I. 666 of 2006". It is Ireland's implementation of the Directive on the energy performance of buildings
