Metre per second (American English: meter per second) is an SI derived unit of both speed (scalar) and velocity (vector quantity which specifies both magnitude and a specific direction), defined by distance in metres divided by time in seconds.
The SI unit symbols are ms1, m s1, m/s, or m/s,[1] sometimes (unofficially) abbreviated as "mps". Where metres per second are several orders of magnitude too slow to be convenient, such as in astronomical measurements, velocities may be given in kilometres per second, where 1km/s is 1000 metres per second, sometimes unofficially abbreviated as "kps".

1 foot per second = 0.3048m/s (exactly)
1 mile per hour = 0.44704m/s (exactly)
1km/h = 0.27m/s (exactly)
1 kilometre per second is equivalent to:

 2237 miles per hour (approximately)
Relation to other measures[edit]
The benz, named in honour of Karl Benz, has been proposed as a name for one metre per second.[2] Although it has seen some support as a practical unit,[3] primarily from German sources,[2] it was rejected as the SI unit of velocity[4] and has not seen widespread use or acceptance.[5]
