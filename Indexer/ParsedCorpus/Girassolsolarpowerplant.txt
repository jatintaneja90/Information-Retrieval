The Moura Photovoltaic Power Station (also known as Amareleja Photovoltaic Power Station) is a large photovoltaic power station in Amareleja, in the municipality of Moura, Portugal. It is one of the largest power stations of its kind, and is built in one of the sunniest regions in Europe.[1] Its construction involved two stages: stage 1 was completed in 2008 after 13 months, and stage 2 was completed in 2010. The entire project topped a total cost of 250 million.[2]
Stage 2 of the project involved the construction of a further 20MW of solar panels.[3][4] It will occupy an area of 618 acres (250ha), and will be capable of producing 93GWh of electrical energy annually[5] (10 MW average - equivalent to the electricity consumption of 15,000 Europeans).[6]
The power station has an installed capacity of 62MWp, with more than 376,000 solar panels.[6] Approximately 190,000 panels (32MW) are fitted on fixed structures, and 52,000 panels (10MW) are fixed on single-axis trackers.
A 7.6 million solar panel factory, located in Moura, was constructed by Acciona, which provided panels for Stage 2 of the station construction. Its future production will be targeted at the international market, with a capacity of producing 24MW of solar panels annually.[7]
