Due to the geological location of Iceland (over a rift in continental plates), the high concentration of volcanoes in the area is often an advantage in the generation of geothermal energy, the heating and making of electricity.[1] During winter, pavements near these areas (such as Reykjavik and Akureyri) are heated up.
Five major geothermal power plants exist in Iceland, which produce approximately 26.2% (2010)[2] of the nation's electricity. In addition, geothermal heating meets the heating and hot water requirements of approximately 87% of all buildings in Iceland. Apart from geothermal energy, 73.8% of the nations electricity is generated by hydro power,[3] and 0.1% from fossil fuels.[citation needed]
Consumption of primary geothermal energy in 2004 was 79.7 petajoules (PJ), approximately 53.4% of the total national consumption of primary energy, 149.1 PJ. The corresponding share for hydro power was 17.2%, petroleum was 26.3%, and coal was 3%.[4] Plans are underway to turn Iceland into a 100% fossil-fuel-free nation in the near future.[5] For example, Iceland's abundant geothermal energy has enabled renewable energy initiatives, such as Carbon Recycling International's carbon dioxide to methanol fuel process.[6] The following are the five largest power stations in Iceland.[7]
Hellisheii Power Station (303 MW)
Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station (120 MW)
Reykjanes Power Station (100 MW)
Svartsengi Power Station (76.5 MW)
Krafla Power Station (60 MW)
