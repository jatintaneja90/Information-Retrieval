gbXML is the underlying architecture of Autodesk's Green Building Studio commercial on-line energy analysis product,[1] and is the main export option for energy analysis from their modeling products.
Green Building XML analysis software[edit]
In order to see the complete list of the software that support gbXML format see gbXML software page.
