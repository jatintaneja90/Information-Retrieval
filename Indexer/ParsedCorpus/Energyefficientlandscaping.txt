There is a distinction between the embedded energy of materials and constructing the landscape, and the energy consumed by the maintenance and operations of a landscape.
Design techniques include:
Planting trees for the purpose of providing shade, which reduces cooling costs.
Planting or building windbreaks to slow winds near buildings, which reduces heat loss.
Wall sheltering, where shrubbery or vines are used to create a windbreak directly against a wall.
Earth sheltering and positioning buildings to take advantage of natural landforms as windbreaks.
Green roofs that cool buildings with extra thermal mass and evapotranspiration.
Reducing the heat island effect with pervious paving, high albedo paving, shade, and minimizing paved areas.
Site lighting with full cut off fixtures, light level sensors, and high efficiency fixtures
Energy-efficient landscaping techniques include using local materials, on-site composting and chipping to reduce greenwaste hauling, hand tools instead of gasoline-powered, and also may involve using drought-resistant plantings in arid areas, buying stock from local growers to avoid energy in transportation, and similar techniques.
