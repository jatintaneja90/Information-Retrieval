The Waldpolenz Solar Park is a 52-megawatt (MW) photovoltaic power station built by German developer and operator Juwi at a former military air base near Leipzig, Eastern Germany. When completed by the end of 2008, it was the world's largest thin-film solar park using CdTe-modules.[1]
Initially, the solar power plant's nameplate capacity was 40 MW, consisting of 500,000 state-of-the-art solar panels provided by U.S. manufacturer First Solar, and generated 40,000MWh of electricity per year.[2] The solar park was then extended with another 153,650 panels, also provided by First Solar, to a final capacity of 52MWP in 2011[3]
The installation is located in the Muldentalkreis district in the state of Saxony in eastern Germany, built on half of the locations 220 hectares (543.6 acres)[4] in the townships of Brandis and Bennewitz.[5] The investment costs for the Waldpolenz solar park have amounted to some 130 million euro.[2]
