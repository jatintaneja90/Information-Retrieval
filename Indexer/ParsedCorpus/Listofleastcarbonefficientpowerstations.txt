Lists were created by the WWF and lists the most polluting power stations in terms of the level of carbon dioxide produced per unit of electricity generated. In 2005 WWF created list of power stations from 30 industrialised countries, also list for EU,[1] in 2007 WWF published updated EU list. In 2009 European Commission list with absolute emissions only, also in 2014 Climate Action Network Europe, WWF, European Environmental Bureau, Health and Environment Alliance and Climate Alliance Germany.
