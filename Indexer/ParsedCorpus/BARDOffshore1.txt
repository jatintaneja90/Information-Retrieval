BARD Offshore 1's location in the wind farms of the German Bight
BARD Offshore 1 is a 400 megawatt (MW) North Sea offshore wind farm with 80 BARD 5.0 turbines. Construction was finished in July 2013[1] and the wind farm was officially inaugurated in August 2013.[2] The wind farm is located 100 kilometres (62mi) northwest of the isle Borkum in 40 metres (130ft) deep water.[3]
Laying of cables to connect the wind farm started on 23 July 2009.[4] The 200km connection is the longest of its kind in the world. It is also the first connection of an offshore wind park realized as HVDC-transmission. Construction of the wind turbines began in March 2010.[5] The first turbine became operational at the beginning of December 2010. Construction was assisted by the purpose-built Wind Lift1 barge / platform, which placed the 470ton, 21 meter foundations on the sea bed.
The project has run into serious and unclear problems, including being three years behind schedule and, at a cost of 3 billion, run significantly over budget. A diver[6] and a worker died during construction.[7][8] The farm was supposed to go online in August 2013, but a series of setbacks, including a fire at a transmission station in March 2014, have delayed its activation.[9] BARD went bankrupt in November 2013.[10] Problems include overvoltage and harmonics[11] between BARD and the BorWin 1 grid link and BorWin Alpha HVDC converter platform.[12]
BARD's original owner had decided to make all components within the company, and troubles from the custom transformer are unrelated to standard equipment used elsewhere.[13]
As of January 2015[update], most of the turbines are not supplying power to shore, costing ratepayers 2million per day.[14]
In September 2015, StatKraft and Ocean Breeze extended their contract for two years.[15]
By May 2016, the company website stated that the wind farm had produced 3 TWh, and was running stable at full capacity.[16]
