History[edit]
The NDRC is a successor to the State Planning Commission (SPC; simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Guji Jhu Wiyunhu and shortened to simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Guji Jwi), which had managed China's centrally planned economy since 1952. In 1998, the SPC was renamed as the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC), which then merged with the State Council Office for Restructuring the Economic System (SCORES) and part of the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) in 2003. Since then the organization further shifted its policy from a planned economy to a socialist market economy. The restructured organization was then merged into a newly created NDRC, which gained greater responsibility and power in overseeing China's economic development.
Principal functions[edit]
The principal functions of the NDRC are:[2]
To formulate and implement macroeconomic policies;
To monitor and adjust the performance of the national economy;
To examine and approve major construction projects;
To guide and promote economic restructuring;
To coordinate the readjustment of China's industrial structure with development of agriculture and rural economy;
To formulate plans for the development of China's energy sector and manage national oil reserves;
To promote the Western Region Development Program, which calls for China's economic growth to include the poorer Western provinces;
To submit a national economic plan to the National People's Congress on behalf of the State Council.
Also, recently the NDRC has been placed in charge of China's strategic petroleum reserves.
