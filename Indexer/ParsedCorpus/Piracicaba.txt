The place name comes from a word in the Tupi language that means "place where the fish stops".[2] The name arises from the fact that the waterfalls of the Piracicaba River, which bisects the city, is a point at which "piracema"fish swimming upstream to reproduce.[3] Larger fish species such as the dourados can still be observed.[citation needed]

In 1766, Antonio Correa Barbosa, charged with the task of establishing a settlement on the estuary of Piracicaba river, opted for a location about 90km from it.[4] The settlement was officially founded on August 1, 1767, as a povoao subordinated to the vila of Itu.[2] In 1784, Piracicaba gets emancipated from Itu, becoming a freguesia.[2]
In 1821, the freguesia is promoted to vila, known as Vila Nova da Constituio. In 1856, Vila Nova da Constituio is promoted to city status and in 1877 it is officially named "Piracicaba", following a law by the then councilman and future Brazilian president Prudente de Morais.[2]
In 1944, the city was made the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Piracicaba.[5]
