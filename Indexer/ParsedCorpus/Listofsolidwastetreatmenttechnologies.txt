Alternative waste treatment technologies[edit]
In the UK these are sometimes termed advanced waste treatment technologies, even though these technologies are not necessarily more complex than the established technologies.
Anaerobic digestion
Alcohol/ethanol production
Bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohol fuels (pilot scale)
Biodrying
Gasification
GasPlasma: Gasification followed by syngas plasma polishing (commercial test scale)
Landfarming
In-vessel composting
Mechanical biological treatment
Mechanical heat treatment
Plasma arc waste disposal (commercial demonstration scale)
Pyrolysis
Refuse-derived fuel
Sewage treatment
Tunnel composting
UASB (applied to solid wastes)
