Honeywell International, Inc. is an American multinational conglomerate company that produces a variety of commercial and consumer products, engineering services and aerospace systems for a wide variety of customers, from private consumers to major corporations and governments. The company operates three business units, known as Strategic Business Units  Honeywell Aerospace, Honeywell Automation and Control Solutions, and Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies.[2][3]
Honeywell is a Fortune 100 company. In 2016, Honeywell ranked 75th in the Fortune 500.[4] Honeywell has a global workforce of approximately 130,000, of whom approximately 58,000 are employed in the United States.[5] The company is headquartered in Morris Plains, New Jersey. Its current chief executive officer is David M. Cote.[6][7] The company and its corporate predecessors were part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index from December 7, 1925 until February 9, 2008.
The company's current name, Honeywell International Inc., is the product of a merger in which Honeywell Inc. was acquired by the much larger AlliedSignal in 1999. The company headquarters were consolidated with AlliedSignal's headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey; however the combined company chose the name "Honeywell" because of its superior brand recognition. In 2015, the headquarters were moved to Morris Plains.
Honeywell has many brands that commercial and retail consumers may recognize, including its line of home thermostats (particularly the iconic round type) and Garrett turbochargers. In addition to consumer home products Honeywell itself produces, such as thermostats, sensors, security alarm systems, and air cleaners and dehumidifiers, the company also licenses its brand name for use in various retail products made by partner manufacturers such as air conditioners, heaters, fans, security safes, home generators, and paper shredders.

History[edit]
The Early Years: 18851927[edit]
Although Mark Honeywells Heating Specialty Company wouldnt be founded until 1906, todays Honeywell traces its roots back to 1885 when the Swiss-born Albert Butz invented the damper-flapper, a thermostat for coal furnaces, to automatically regulate heating systems.[8] The following year he founded the Butz Thermo-Electric Regulator Company. In 1888, after a falling out with his investors, Butz left the company and transferred the patents to the legal firm Paul, Sanford, and Merwin, who renamed the company the Consolidated Temperature Controlling Company.[8] As the years passed, CTCC struggled with growing debts, and they underwent several name changes in an attempt to keep the business afloat. After the company was renamed to the Electric Heat Regulator Company in 1893, W.R. Sweatt, a stockholder in the company, was sold "an extensive list of patents" and named secretary-treasurer.[9]:22 On February 23, 1898 he bought out the remaining shares of the company from the other stockholders.
In 1906, Mark Honeywell founded the Honeywell Heating Specialty Company in Wabash, Indiana to manufacture and market his invention, the mercury seal generator. As Honeywells company grew (thanks in part to the acquisition of Jewell Manufacturing Company in 1922 to better automate his heating system) it began to clash with the renamed Minneapolis Heat Regulator Company. This led to the merging of the two companies into the publicly held Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Company in 1927. Honeywell named its first president, W.R. Sweatt as its first chairman.[10]
International Expansion and Acquisition: 19271985[edit]
W.R. Sweatt and his son Harold provided 75 years of uninterrupted leadership for the company. W.R. Sweatt survived rough spots and turned an innovative idea  thermostatic heating control  into a thriving business. Harold, who took over in 1934, led Honeywell through a period of growth and global expansion that set the stage for Honeywell to become a global technology leader. The merger into the Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Company proved to be a saving grace for the corporation. The combined assets were valued at over $3.5 million, with less than $1 million in liabilities just months before Black Monday.[9]:49 In 1931, Minneapolis-Honeywell began a period of expansion and acquisition when they purchased Time-O-Stat Controls Company, giving the company access to a greater number of patents to be used in their controls systems. 1934 marked Minneapolis-Honeywells first foray into the international market, when they acquired the Brown Instrument Company, and inherited their relationship with the Yamatake Company of Tokyo, a Japan-based distributor.[9]:51 Later that same year, Minneapolis-Honeywell would also start distributorships across Canada, as well as one in the Netherlands, their first European office. This expansion into international markets continued in 1936, with their first distributorship in London, as well as their first foreign assembly facility being established in Canada. By 1937, ten years after the merger, Minneapolis-Honeywell had over 3,000 employees, with $16 million in annual revenue.[8]
Having survived the Depression, Minneapolis-Honeywell was approached by the US military for engineering and manufacturing projects. In 1941, Minneapolis-Honeywell developed a superior tank periscope and camera stabilizers, as well as the C-1 autopilot. The C-1 revolutionized precision bombing in the war effort, and was used on the two B-29 bombers that dropped atomic bombs on Japan in 1945. The success of these projects led Minneapolis-Honeywell to open an Aero division in Chicago on October 5, 1942.[9]:73 This division was responsible for the development of the formation stick to control autopilots, more accurate gas gauges for planes, and the turbo supercharger.[9]:79 In 1950, Minneapolis-Honeywells Aero division was contracted for the controls on the first US nuclear submarine, USS Nautilus.[9]:88 The following year, the company acquired Intervox Company for their sonar, ultrasonics, and telemetry technologies. Honeywell also helped develop and manufacture the RUR-5 ASROC for the US Navy. In 1953, in cooperation with the USAF Wright-Air Development Center, Honeywell developed an automated control unit that could control an aircraft through various stages of a flight, from taxiing, to takeoff, to the point where the aircraft neared its destination and the pilot took over for landing. Called the Automatic Master Sequence Selector, the onboard control operated similarly to a player piano to relay instructions to the aircraft's autopilot at certain way points during the flight, significantly reducing the pilot's workload.[11] Technologically, this effort had parallels to contemporary efforts in missile guidance and numerical control. Honeywell also developed the Wagtail missile with the USAF.
Honeywell-Pentax-Spotmatic
From the 1950s until the mid-1970s, Honeywell was the United States' importer of Pentax cameras and photographic equipment.[9]:153 These products were labeled Honeywell Pentax in the U.S. In 1953, Honeywell introduced their most famous product, the T-86 Round thermostat.[8][9]:110

On April 12, 1955, Minneapolis-Honeywell started a joint venture with Raytheon called Datamatic to enter the computer market and compete with IBM.[9]:118 Two years later in 1957, their first computer, the D-1000, was sold and installed. In 1960, just five years after embarking on this venture with Raytheon, Minneapolis-Honeywell bought out Raytheons interest in Datamatic and turned it into the Electronic Data Processing division (now Honeywell Information Systems) of Minneapolis-Honeywell.[9]:118 Honeywell also purchased minicomputer pioneer Computer Control Corporation (3C's), renaming it as Honeywell's Computer Control Division. Through most of the 1960s, Honeywell was one of the "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" of computing. IBM was "Snow White", while the dwarfs were the seven significantly smaller computer companies: Burroughs, Control Data Corporation, General Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, and UNIVAC. Later, when their number had been reduced to five,[12] they were known as "The BUNCH", after their initials: Burroughs, UNIVAC, NCR, Control Data Corporation, and Honeywell.

In 1961, James H. Binger became Honeywells president and in 1965 its chairman. On becoming Chairman of Honeywell, Binger revamped the company sales approach, placing emphasis on profits rather than on volume. He also stepped up the company's international expansion  it had six plants producing 12% of the company's revenue. He also officially changed the company's corporate name from "Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co." to "Honeywell", to better represent their colloquial name. Throughout the 1960s, Honeywell continued to acquire other businesses, including Security Burglar Alarm Company in 1969.[9]:130
The beginning of the 1970s saw Honeywell focus on process controls, with the company merging their computer operations with GEs information systems in 1970, and later acquiring GEs process control business.[9]:122 With the acquisition, Honeywell took over responsibility for GE's ongoing Multics operating system project. The design and features of Multics greatly influenced the Unix operating system. Multics also influenced many of the features of Honeywell/GE's GECOS and GCOS8 General Comprehensive Operating System operating systems. Honeywell, Groupe Bull, and Control Data Corporation formed a joint venture in Magnetic Peripherals Inc. which became a major player in the hard disk drive market. It was the worldwide leader in 14-inch disk drive technology in the OEM marketplace in the 1970s and early 1980s especially with its SMD (Storage Module Drive) and CMD (Cartridge Module Drive). In the second half of the 1970s, Honeywell started to look to international markets again, acquiring the French Compagnie Internationale pour lInformatique in 1976.[9]:124 Eight years later, Honeywell formed Honeywell High Tech Trading to lease their foreign marketing and distribution to other companies abroad, in order to establish a better position in those markets.[9]:147 Under Binger's stewardship from 1961 to 1978 he expanded the company into such fields as defense, aerospace, and computing. During and after the Vietnam Era, Honeywell's defense division produced a number of products, including cluster bombs, missile guidance systems, napalm, and land mines. Minnesota-Honeywell Corporation completed flight tests on an inertia guidance sub-system for the X-20 project at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, utilizing an NF-101B Voodoo by August 1963. The X-20 project was canceled in December 1963.[13] The Honeywell project, founded in 1968, organized protests against the company to persuade it to abandon weapons production[14]
In 1980, Honeywell bought Incoterm Corporation to compete in both the airline reservations system networks and bank teller markets.
In the 1980s, Honeywell developed the first Digital Process Communications protocol for its smart transmitters used in process measurement. Since then, smart communication protocols have evolved into various standardized types, such as the HART protocol and DE protocol.
Integration: Aerospace and Home & Building Controls: 19861999[edit]
Aerospace[edit]
1986 marked a new direction for Honeywell, beginning with the acquisition of Sperry Aerospace.[8] The same year, they conceded control of the computer market to IBM and discontinued their computer business. In 1990, Honeywell spun off their Defense and Marine Systems business into Alliant Techsystems, as well as their Test Instruments division and Signal Analysis Center to streamline the companys focus.[9]:177 Honeywell continues to supply aerospace products including electronic guidance systems, cockpit instrumentation, lighting, and primary propulsion and secondary power turbine engines.
In 1996, Honeywell acquired Duracraft and began marketing its products in the home comfort sector. Today, Kaz Incorporated licenses and sells both Duracraft and Honeywell's home comfort lines.
Honeywell is in the consortium that runs the Pantex Plant that assembles all of the nuclear bombs in the United States arsenal. Honeywell Federal Manufacturing & Technologies, successor to the defense products of AlliedSignal, operates the Kansas City Plant which produces and assembles 85 percent of the non-nuclear components of the bombs.[15]
Home & Building Controls[edit]
Honeywell also began the SmartHouse project to combine heating, cooling, security, lighting, and appliances into one easily controlled system. They continued the trend in 1987 by releasing new security systems, and fire and radon detectors. Five years later, in another streamlining effort, Honeywell combined their Residential Controls, Commercial Systems, and Protections Services divisions into Home and Building Control, which then acquired the Enviracare air cleaner business.[9]:183 By 1995, Honeywell had condensed into three divisions: Space and Aviation Control, Home and Building Control, and Industrial Control.
Corporate Takeovers: 19992002[edit]
AlliedSignal and Pittway[edit]
Main articles: AlliedSignal and Pittway
On June 7, 1999, Honeywell was acquired by AlliedSignal, who elected to retain the Honeywell name for its brand recognition.[8] The former Honeywell moved their headquarters of 114 years to AlliedSignal's in Morristown, NJ. While "technically, the deal looks more like an acquisition than a merger...from a strategic standpoint, it is a merger of equals."[16] AlliedSignal's 1998 revenue was reported at $15.1 billion to Honeywell's $8.4 billion, but together the companies share huge business interests in aerospace, chemical products, automotive parts, and building controls.
In 2000, the new Honeywell acquired Pittway for $2.2 billion to gain a greater share of the fire-protection and security systems market, and merged it into their Home and Building Control division,[17] taking on Pittway's $167 million in debt. Analyst David Jarrett commented that "while Honeywell offered a hefty premium, it's still getting Pittway for a bargain" at $45.50 per share, despite closing at $29 the week before.[18] Pittways Ademco products complemented Honeywells existing unified controls systems.
General Electric Company[edit]
In October 2000, Honeywell (then valued at over $21 billion) accepted a takeover bid from then-CEO Jack Welch of General Electric.[19] The American Department of Justice cleared the merger, while "GE teams swooped down on Honeywell" and "GE executives took over budget planning and employee reviews." However, on July 3, 2001, the European Commission's competition commissioner, Mario Monti blocked the move.[20] This decision was taken on the grounds that with GE's dominance of the large jet engine market (led by the General Electric CF34 turbofan engine), its leasing services (GECAS), and Honeywell's portfolio of regional jet engines and avionics, the new company would be able to "bundle" products and stifle competition through the creation of a horizontal monopoly. US regulators disagreed, finding that the merger would improve competition and reduce prices; United States Assistant Attorney General Charles James called the EU's decision "antithetical to the goals of antitrust law enforcement."[21][22] This led to a drop in morale and general tumult throughout Honeywell, and in turn, the then-CEO Michael Bonsignore was fired as Honeywell looked to turn their business around.
Recent history[edit]
The current "Honeywell International Inc." is the product of a merger between AlliedSignal and Honeywell Inc. Although AlliedSignal was twice the size of Honeywell, the combined company chose the name "Honeywell" because of its superior brand recognition. However, the corporate headquarters were consolidated to AlliedSignal's headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey rather than Honeywell's former headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. When Honeywell closed its corporate headquarters in Minneapolis, over one thousand employees lost their jobs. A few moved to Morristown or other company locations, but the majority were forced to find new jobs or retire. Soon after the merger, the company's stock fell significantly, and did not return to its pre-merger level until 2007. In January 2002 Knorr-Bremse who had been operating in a joint venture with Honeywell International Inc. assumed full ownership of its ventures in Europe, Brazil, and the USA. Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems became a subsidiary of Knorr-Bremse AG. Although declining in influence, Honeywell maintains a presence in emerging industries, such as Northern Alberta's oil sands. Honeywell's Plant integrator is currently deployed in some of the most important plant-sites in the Oil Sands (Syncrude, Suncor, and others).
In February 2002, Honeywells board appointed their current CEO and Chairman, David M. Cote. Cote has been instrumental in uniting the company cultures of Honeywell, AlliedSignal, and Pittway. Since 2002, Honeywell has made more than 80 acquisitions and 60 divestures, while adding $12 billion in new sales[23] and increasing its labor force to 131,000 as a result of these acquisitions. Since his appointment, Honeywell's stock has nearly tripled from $35.23 in April 2002 to $99.39 as of January 2015.[24]
In December 2004, Honeywell made a 1.2bn ($2.3bn) bid for Novar plc.[25][26] The acquisition was finalized on March 31, 2005.[27][28] In October 2005, Honeywell bought out Dow's 50% stake in UOP for $825 million, giving them complete control over the joint venture in petrochemical and refining technology.[29] In May 2010, Honeywell outbid UK-based Cinven and acquired the French company Sperian Protection for $1.4 billion, which was then incorporated into its automation and controls safety unit.[30]
In October 2015, Honeywell moved its international headquarters from Morristown to Morris Plains. The 475,000-square-foot building on 40 acres in Morris Plains features state-of-the-art technology and greater energy efficiency than Honeywells Morristown campus, which was underutilized, outdated and costly, according to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote.
On December 29, 2015 Honeywell completed the sale of Elster for US$5.1B (announced on July 28, 2015) entering the space of gas electricity and water meters with a specific focus on smart meters and hoped to be a growth driver for Honeywell in 2016 and beyond. The deal also complements the HON Combustion business with the addition of Elster with strong brands such as Kromschroeder and Eclipse.
In January 2016, Honeywell International Inc. acquired the 30% stake in UOP Russell LLC it didn't own already for roughly $240 million.[31]
In February 2016 Honeywell entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xtralis, a leading global provider of aspirating smoke detection along with advanced perimeter security technologies and video analytics software, for $480 million from funds advised by Pacific Equity Partners and Blum Capital Partners.[32]
On April 1, 2016, Honeywell announced that it had completed its acquisition of Xtralis.[33]
In May 2016, Honeywell International Inc. settled its patent dispute regarding Google subsidiary Nest Labs, whose thermostats Honeywell claimed infringed on several of its patents. Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Honeywell said they reached a "patent cross-license" agreement that "fully resolves" the long-standing dispute. Honeywell sued Nest Labs in 2012.[34]
On September 12, 2016, Morris Plain, N.J.-based Honeywell announced that it will invest $20 million in the first-of-its-kind software development center and relocate the headquarters of its nearly $10 billion home and building technologies division from suburban Minneapolis to Atlanta. The expansion will create more than 800 jobs.[35]

Environmental record[edit]
The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that no corporation has been linked to a greater number of Superfund toxic waste sites than has Honeywell.[116] Honeywell ranks 44th in a list of US corporations most responsible for air pollution, releasing more than 4.25 million kg (9.4 million pounds) of toxins per year into the air.[117] In 2001, Honeywell agreed to pay $150,000 in civil penalties and to perform $772,000 worth of reparations for environmental violations involving:[118]
failure to prevent or repair leaks of hazardous organic pollutants into the air
failure to repair or report refrigeration equipment containing chlorofluorocarbons
inadequate reporting of benzene, ammonia, nitrogen oxide, dichlorodifluoromethane, sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, and caprolactam emissions
In 2003, a federal judge in Newark, New Jersey ordered the company to perform an estimated $400 million environmental remediation of chromium waste, citing "a substantial risk of imminent damage to public health and safety and imminent and severe damage to the environment."[119] In the same year, Honeywell paid $3.6 million to avoid a federal trial regarding its responsibility for trichloroethylene contamination in Lisle, Illinois.[120] In 2004, the State of New York announced that it would require Honeywell to complete an estimated $448 million cleanup of more than 74,000kg (165,000lbs) of mercury and other toxic waste dumped into Onondaga Lake in Syracuse, NY.[121] As of November 2014, Honeywell has completed dredging the lake and established three water treatment plants, and the chemicals cleanup site has removed 7 tons of mercury.[122]
In 2005, the state of New Jersey sued Honeywell, Occidental Petroleum, and PPG to compel cleanup of more than 100 sites contaminated with chromium, a metal linked to lung cancer, ulcers, and dermatitis.[123] In 2008, the state of Arizona made a settlement with Honeywell to pay a $5 million fine and contribute $1 million to a local air-quality cleanup project, after allegations of breaking water-quality and hazardous-waste laws on hundreds of occasions between the years of 1974 and 2004.[124]
In 2006, Honeywell announced that its decision to stop manufacturing mercury switches had resulted in reductions of more than 11,300kg, 2800kg, and 1500kg respectively of mercury, lead, and chromic acid usage. The largest reduction represents 5% of mercury use in the United States.[125] The EPA acknowledged Honeywell's leadership in reducing mercury use through a 2006 National Partnership for Environmental Priorities (NPEP) Achievement Award for discontinuing the manufacturing of mercury switches.[126]
Criticism[edit]

On March 10, 2013, the WSJ reported that Honeywell was one of sixty companies that shielded annual profits from U.S. taxes.[127] In December 2011, the non-partisan liberal organization Public Campaign criticized Honeywell International for spending $18.3 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 20082010, instead getting $34 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $4.9 billion, laying off 968 workers since 2008, and increasing executive pay by 15% to $54.2 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives.[128] Honeywell has been criticized in the past for its manufacture of deadly and maiming weapons, such as cluster bombs.[129]
