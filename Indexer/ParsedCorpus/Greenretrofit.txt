Simple steps[edit]
Steps home owners can do include the following:[4]
Insulation, primarily roof/ceiling/attic and secondary walls and floor
Retrofitting heating equipments in older houses, results in household savings of 3080% due to cut in energy-use and a reduction of CO2-outlets by 30100%.[6]
Thermostats in all rooms
New windows.
Plugging air leaks.
Tuning up heating and cooling (HVAC) systems.
Switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs and/or LED light bulbs
Choosing appliances with low energy consumption. In the United States, this is certified by the Energy Star.
Reducing water use by installing aerators and low-flow showerheads
Switching to green power, including solar energy and renewables such as heating-pellets and bio-gas
Using low-VOC products to improve indoor air quality
Planting native plants and other appropriate landscaping measures.

^ An old gas-boiler has an energy-efficiency of 65% and a new one 93% resulting in a 30% energy reduction and consequently a 30% CO2-reduction, if installing a wood-chips or pellets boiler the savings will be increased efficiency + cheaper fuel resulting in a total saving of 4050% and a CO2-reduction of 100% (renewable energy), if installing an efficient heat-pump the savings and the reduction will both be around 80% (100% CO2 reduction if the electricity comes from renewable energy).[citation needed]
