The Ffestiniog Pumped Storage dam in Wales, UK, is an early example of a major energy storage facility, built in 1963.
The 150 MW Andasol solar power station is a commercial parabolic trough solar thermal power plant, located in Spain. The Andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt to store captured solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity when the sun isn't shining.[1]
This is a list of energy storage projects worldwide. Many individual energy storage projects augment electrical grids by capturing excess electrical energy during periods of low demand and storing it in other forms until needed on an electrical grid. The energy is later converted back to its electrical form and returned to the grid as needed.
Another energy storage method is the consumption of surplus or low-cost energy (typically during night time) for conversion into resources such as hot water, cool water or ice, which is then used for heating or cooling at other times when electricity is in higher demand and at greater cost per kilowatt hour (kWh). Such thermal energy storage is often employed at end-user sites such as large buildings, and also as part of district heating, thus 'shifting' energy consumption to other times for better balancing of supply and demand.
Some notable energy storage projects include Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations, Bear Swamp Hydroelectric Power Station, Seneca Pumped Storage Generating Station, Salina Pumped Storage Project, Carters Dam, Smith Mountain Dam, and Matanoagawa Dam.

2,860
(110 x 26)
The 2nd commercial CAES plant, in operation since 1991, stores compressed air in a salt cavern of 220ft diameter, with ten million cubic foot total volume. The cavern is pressurized to 1,100 psi, and it is discharged down to 650 psi. During discharge, 340 pounds per second of air flow out of the cavern. The cavern can discharge for 26 hours. The plant also utilizes nuclear-sourced night-time power for compression and then produces peak power during the day by releasing the compressed air into a 110-MW gas-fired combustion turbine. The turbine unit also makes use of an air-to-air heat exchanger to preheat air from the cavern with waste heat from the turbine. The waste heat recovery system reduces fuel usage by roughly 25%. The system is fully operational within 15 minutes, uses a third of the fuel required for a fuel-only generating system, and can operate efficiently at low loads. The project is used for peak shaving.

(1 x 1.4)
Metlakatla Power and Light (MP&L) has a BESS installation consisting of Exide (GNB Industrial Power) VRLA cells, providing rapid spinning reserve, frequency control, and better power quality. Beginning operation in 1997, the MP&L BESS has a 1 MW peak power output, and 1.4 MWh energy capacity. It is capable of supporting continuous loads of 800 kilovolt amperes (KVA), pulse loads up to 1200 KVA, and consists of 378 Absolyte VRLA 100A75 modules. Nearly 5 MW of hydroelectric generation capacity provides almost all of MP&Ls power, with a 3.3 MW diesel generation system relegated to reserve duty. MP&Ls two hydroelectric plants, Purple Lake and Chester Lake, have reservoir storage capacity, though the hydro generators were too slow to respond to sudden load fluctuations. At the time of the BESSs initial operations, the MP&L peak load was approximately 4 MW. MP&L is now replacing the batteries after 12 years of service.

(0.01 x 1)
Amber Kinetics is developing a flywheel system from sub-scale research prototype to full-scale mechanical flywheel battery and will conduct both a commercial-scale and a utility-scale demonstration. The goal is to deliver a cost-effective prototype flywheel system that can be grid connected and electrically charged and discharged.
The system will have built-in sensing components that can determine frequency and voltage characteristics of the grid and can override the grid signal to manage the amount of electricity discharged. The flywheel stores energy in a spinning rotor that is connected to an electric motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. To recover the energy the motor is electrically reversed and used as a generator to slow down the flywheel converting the mechanical energy back into electrical energy.
Amber Kinetics will improve the traditional flywheel system by engineering breakthroughs in three areas, resulting in higher efficiency and radically reduced cost: magnetic bearings, low-cost rotor, and high-efficiency motor generator. This technology can also be used to optimize existing infrastructure/pdfs
