Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) in California, with the combined capacity from three separate locations at 354 megawatts (MW, 474,700hp), is now the world's second largest solar thermal energy generating facility, after the commissioning of the even larger Ivanpah facility in 2014. It consists of nine solar power plants in California's Mojave Desert, where insolation is among the best available in the United States. SEGS III (44MW) are located at Daggett (345145N 1164945W / 34.86250N 116.82917W / 34.86250; -116.82917), SEGSIIIVII (150MW) are installed at Kramer Junction (350043N 1173332W / 35.01194N 117.55889W / 35.01194; -117.55889), and SEGS VIIIIX (160MW) are placed at Harper Lake (350155N 1172050W / 35.03194N 117.34722W / 35.03194; -117.34722).[1] NextEra Energy Resources operates and partially owns the plants located at Kramer Junction and Harper Lake. A tenth plant (SEGS X, 80MW) had been in construction and SEGS XI and SEGS XII had been planned by Luz Industries, but the developer filed for bankruptcy in 1992, because it was unable to secure construction financing.[2]

Plants' scale and operations[edit]
The plants have a 354 MW net (394 MW gross) installed capacity. The nameplate capacity, which operating continuously, would dliver the sam net power output, coming only from the solar source is around 75 MWe , representing a 21% capacity factor. In addition, the turbines can be utilized at night by burning natural gas.
NextEra claims that the solar plants power 232,500 homs (during the day, at peak power) and displace 3,800tons of pollution pr year that would have been produced if the electricity had bn providd by fossil fuels, such as oil.[3]
The facilities have a total of 936,384 mirrors and cover more than 1,600 acres (647.5ha). Lined up, the parabolic mirrors would extend over 229 miles (369km).
As an example of cost, in 2002, one of the 30 MW Kramer Junction sites required $90 million to construct, and its operation and maintenance cost was about $3 million per year (4.6 cents per kilowatt hour).[4] With a considered lifetime of 20 years, the operation, maintenance and investments interest and depreciation triples the price, to approximately 14 cents per kilowatt hour.[citation needed]
Principle of operation[edit]
Sketch of a Parabolic Trough Collector
The installation uses parabolic trough, solar thermal technology along with natural gas to generate electricity. About 90% of the electricity is produced by the sunlight.[citation needed] Natural gas is only used when the solar power is insufficient to meet the demand from Southern California Edison, the distributor of power in southern California.
Mirrors[edit]
The parabolic mirrors are shaped like quarter-pipes. The sun shines onto the panels made of glass, which are 94%reflective, unlike a typical mirror, which is only 70%reflective. The mirrors automatically track the sun throughout the day. The greatest source of mirror breakage is wind, with 3,000 mirrors typically replaced each year. Operators can turn the mirrors to protect them during intense wind storms. An automated washing mechanism is used to periodically clean the parabolic reflective panels.
Heat transfer[edit]
The sunlight bounces off the mirrors and is directed to a central tube filled with synthetic oil, which heats to over 400C (750F). The reflected light focused at the central tube is 71 to 80times more intense than the ordinary sunlight. The synthetic oil transfers its heat to water, which boils and drives the Rankine cycle steam turbine,[5] thereby generating electricity. Synthetic oil is used to carry the heat (instead of water) to keep the pressure within manageable parameters.
Individual locations[edit]
The SEGS power plants were built by Luz Industries,[5][6] and commissioned between December 20, 1984 and October 1, 1990.[7] After Luz Industries' bankruptcy in 1991 plants were sold to various investor groups as individual projects, and expansion including three more plants was halted.[2]
Kramer Junction employs about 95people and 45people work at Harper Lake.

Harper Lake[edit]
SEGS VIII and SEGS IX, located at 350155N 1172050W / 35.031815N 117.347270W / 35.031815; -117.347270 (SEGS VIII and IX), until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility commissioning in 2014, were the largest solar thermal power plants individually and collectively in the world.[22] They were the last, the largest, and the most advanced of the nine plants at SEGS, designed to take advantage of the economies of scale. Construction of the tenth plant in the same locality was halted because of the bankruptcy of Luz Industries. Construction of the approved eleventh and twelfth plants never started. Each of the three planned plants had 80 MW of installed capacity.[23] Abengoa Solar recently constructed the 280MW Mojave Solar Project (MSP) adjacent to the SEGS VIII and SEGS IX plants.[24] The MSP also uses concentrating solar thermal trough technology.
Kramer Junction[edit]
The reflectors at Kramer Junction site facing the western sky to focus the late afternoon sunlight at the absorber tubes partially seen in the picture as bright white spots.
This location (350048N 1173338W / 35.013218N 117.560531W / 35.013218; -117.560531 (SEGS IIIVII)) receives an average of 340days of sunshine per year, which makes it an ideal place for solar power generation. The average direct normal radiation (DNR) is 7.44kWh/m/day (310W/m),[9] one of the best in the nation[citation needed].
Daggett[edit]
SEGS I and II are located at 345147N 1164937W / 34.8631N 116.827W / 34.8631; -116.827 (SEGS I and II) and are owned by Cogentrix Energy (Carlyle Group).[25] SEGS II was shut down in 2014 and will be replaced with 44 MW of photovoltaics, Sunray Energy 2.[26]
Accidents and incidents[edit]
In February 1999, a 900,000-US-gallon (3,400m3) Mineral Oil storage tank exploded at the SEGS I (Daggett) solar power plant, sending flames and smoke into the sky. Authorities were trying to keep flames away from two adjacent containers that held sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide. The immediate area of 0.5 square miles (1.3km2) was evacuated.[27]
