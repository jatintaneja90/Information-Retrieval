Renewable energy by type[edit]
Renewable electricity[edit]
Main article: Renewable electricity in New Zealand
Renewable electricity in New Zealand is primarily from hydropower. In 2015, 81% of the electricity generated in New Zealand came from renewable sources.[1] In September 2007, former Prime Minister Helen Clark announced a national target of 90 percent renewable electricity by 2025, with wind energy to make up much of that increase.[2]
Solar power[edit]
Main article: Solar power in New Zealand
Small amounts of photovoltaic solar have been installed in New Zealand. High-temperature solar thermal energy plants are not likely to be adopted due to the variable solar radiation in New Zealand. It is unlikely to be economically viable.[3]
Solar hot water[edit]
Main article: Solar hot water in New Zealand
Installation of solar hot water heating systems is increasing in New Zealand due in part to government incentive schemes.
Biofuels[edit]
Main article: Biofuel in New Zealand
Biodiesel, bioethanol and biomass (generally in the form of wood) are all used in New Zealand as a source of renewable energy.
