Geothermal[edit]
Main article: Geothermal power in Chile
With 15% of the world's volcanoes, Chile has vast geothermal potential, estimated at 16,000 MW. This includes the El Tatio geyser field, with 8% of the world's geysers.[4]
Solar energy[edit]
Main article: Solar power in Chile
The 246MW El Romero solar photovoltaic plant open in November 2016 at Vallenar in the Atacama region[5] It was the largest solar farm in Latin America when it opened.
In 2016, SolarPack won an electricity auction (held without disclosing bidders' power source) by bidding $29.1/MWh;[6] a record low price.[7]
Wind energy[edit]
The 115 MW El Arrayn Wind Farm is the largest in Chile,[8] and at the time of its inauguration in 2014 it was the largest in Latin America.[2]
The 2016 electricity auction for a combined 12.34 TWh was won partly by wind power. Mainstream Renewable Power won 7 projects with 985 MW supplying 3.7 TWh/year at between $38.8 and $47.2 per MWh.[7]
