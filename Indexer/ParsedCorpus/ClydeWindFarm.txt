Planning[edit]
The 152-turbine project by Scottish and Southern Energy was approved by the Scottish Parliament in July 2008, and is capable of powering 200,000 homes.[1] SSE was given planning permission to build a wind farm with turbines built on either side of the M74 motorway.[2]
Construction[edit]
Construction of the wind farm, which was budgeted for 600 million, began in early 2009 and finished in 2012.[3] Welcon Towers Ltd won the contract to supply the towers for all 152 turbines for the 600 million Clyde Wind Farm. Jesper hlenschlger, chief executive officer of Welcon Towers parent company Skykon, said: The Clyde project is a very important business win for our Campbeltown manufacturing. Scotland has become the most positive and the most interesting renewable wind power market in Europe. The Clyde Wind Farm project represents a landmark phase in Scotlands renewable energy strategy.[4]
The farm was opened at a ceremonial ribbon cutting by First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond in September 2012.[5]
Extension[edit]
In July 2014 it was announced that Scottish ministers had approved an extension to the Clyde Wind Farm.[6] The extension will see 54 extra turbines, capable of generating an additional 162MW. This will bring the total generating capacity of the wind farm to 512MW.[6]
