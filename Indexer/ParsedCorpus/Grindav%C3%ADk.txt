History[edit]
Grindavk from the air in May 2011.
Landnma or The Book of Settlements mentions that around 934 two Viking settlers, Molda-Gnpur Hrlfsson and rir Haustmyrkur Vgbjsson, arrived in the Reykjanes area. rir settled in Selvogur, and Krsuvk and Molda-Gnpur in Grindavk.[1]
The sons of Moldar-Gnpur established three settlements; rktlustaahverfi, Jrngerarstaarhverfi and Staarhverfi. The modern version of Grindavik is situated mainly in what was Jrngerarstaarhverfi.
The origins of the municipality can be traced to Einar Einarsson's decision to move there to build and run a shop in 1897. During that time the population was only around 360. Fishing had for centuries been a crucial element in the survival of Grindavik's population, but fishing trips were often dangerous. Men were frequently lost at sea and the catch not always stable. However, when a safer access point to land was created at Hpi in 1939, fishing conditions changed dramatically. From 1950 serious development in the fishing industry had begun to take place. Grindavik was declared a municipality in 1974.

Activities[edit]
A short distance to the north, there is the Blue Lagoon (Icelandic: Bla Lni), a geothermal spa using hot and mineralized waters from the nearby Svartsengi power station.
Ungmennaflag Grindavkur (Umfg) is the town's sport club, and the town contains the Grindavkurvllur stadium.
The Leif the Lucky Bridge spans the lfagj rift valley that marks the boundary of the Eurasian and North American continental tectonic plates. It was built in 2002 and named in honor of Icelandic explorer Leif Erikson, who travelled from Europe to explore North America 500 years before Columbus.
The Icelandic Saltfish Museum in Grindavk opened in September 2002. It displays the story of salt fish production and its importance for the Icelandic economy throughout the centuries in a specially designed building of 650 square metres (7,000sqft).
Notable residents[edit]
The Icelandic writer Gubergur Bergsson was born here, and Kalli Bjarni, the first winner of the Icelandic version of Pop Idol, lives in the town. The Spanish publisher and writer Jaime Salinas Bonmat, engaged to Gubergur Bergsson, lived, died and is buried here. Icelandic footballer Alfre Finnbogason was also born in Grindavk.
